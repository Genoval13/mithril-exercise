# FSR Interview

## Use these folders to interview FSR's

1. Books (Poorly formed `JSON`, Improper use of a `$.get` `Deferred`, Bad `script` tag)
  * run `npm install`
  * run `npm start`
  * open `http://localhost:8080`
  * Act like a student and get the FSR to help with displaying the books on the page.
    * Optional angular example if they're rusty on jQuery
2. db (Missing `Promise` return from migration file)
  * run `npm install`
  * run `npm install -g knex`
  * run `knex migrate:latest`
  * check psql to verify the db is not populated
  * Get a student to help with getting the migration to work.
3. Vue.js (Just some incorrect usage of `Vue.js`)
  * run `npm install`
  * run `npm start`
  * open `http://localhost:8080`
  * Get the student to realize they are unfamiliar and open the Vue.js docs to help debug the problem
